      <h3> Aircraft Detection System - Computer Vision </h3>
      <p>Engineered an end-to-end Aircraft Detection System using an optimized YOLOv11 deep learning model, achieving 94.2%
mAP and real-time performance for object detection in satellite and drone imagery via an optimized inference pipeline.
      
         
   Architected a production-grade RESTful API using FastAPI with Docker and CI/CD, supporting single image, video
stream, and batch processing to handle 1000+ daily detection requests, Providing API key authentication, and
automated resource management.
